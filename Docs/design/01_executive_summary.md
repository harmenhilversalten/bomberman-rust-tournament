## 1.1 Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive low-level design for the Bomberman Rust Tournament project, a high-performance AI agent system for a Bomberman-inspired game. The design is based on the high-level architecture in [`Docs/Architecture.md`](../Architecture.md) and follows the crate structure defined there, using `docs/example/example_crate` as a template for individual crate designs.

### Key Design Decisions and Trade-offs

1. **Modular Architecture**: The system is divided into 10 specialized crates, each with a single responsibility. This enhances maintainability but requires careful interface design to avoid performance bottlenecks.

2. **Performance-First Approach**: All design decisions prioritize meeting the strict performance requirements (â‰¤ 1 ms median decision time per bot). This leads to more complex implementations in some areas but is necessary for the target use case.

3. **Lock-Free Concurrency**: The system uses lock-free data structures and atomic operations to minimize contention, which improves performance but increases implementation complexity.

4. **Memory Efficiency**: With a 16 MB limit per bot, the design emphasizes memory pooling, zero-copy techniques, and cache-friendly data layouts.

5. **Deterministic Simulation**: The system ensures bit-identical replays through careful state management and seeded RNG, which slightly constrains some implementation choices.
