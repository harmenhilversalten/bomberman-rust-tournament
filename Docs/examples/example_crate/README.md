# Example Crate

This crate demonstrates a minimal SOLID architecture. It provides small modules
and traits so that agents can use it as a reference for clean, maintainable code.

- `src/traits` contains trait definitions that decouple behavior from
  implementations.
- `src/examples` provides simple example implementations using the traits.
- Unit tests showcase how the modules work together.

The code is intentionally concise, focusing on clarity and good structure.
