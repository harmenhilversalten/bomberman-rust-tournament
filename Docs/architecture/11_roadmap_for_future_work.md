## 11. Roadmap for Future Work

### 11.1 Performance and Scalability Enhancements

The architecture is designed with future performance and scalability enhancements in mind. One significant area is the optimization of the InfluenceMap calculations. While incremental updates and parallel processing with rayon are initial steps, future work could explore GPU acceleration for these computations, potentially using frameworks like wgpu. This would be particularly beneficial for very large maps or extremely high numbers of simultaneous explosions. Another avenue for scalability is improving the handling of massive maps, such as 1024x1024 grids. This might involve streaming techniques for game state, where only relevant portions of the map are fully loaded or processed by an agent, or more sophisticated data structures for sparse map representations. These enhancements aim to push the boundaries of the AI system's capacity, allowing for even more complex and large-scale Bomberman simulations.

### 11.2 Advanced RL and Multi-Agent Support

The roadmap includes significant advancements in Reinforcement Learning capabilities. A key area is supporting multi-agent RL (MARL) scenarios, where multiple agents learn simultaneously, potentially in cooperative or competitive settings. This would involve extending the Gym wrapper to handle multi-agent environments and integrating algorithms suited for MARL, like QMIX or MADDPG. Another focus is the development of hybrid programmatic-NN ensembles. This involves developing sophisticated ways to combine the strengths of pre-programmed heuristic AI with the adaptive learning capabilities of neural networks. For example, an NN might override specific sub-components of a programmatic agent, or programmatic logic could provide safe exploratory behaviors or interpretable fallbacks for an NN-driven agent. Distributed RL training via gRPC or other RPC mechanisms is also on the roadmap, allowing training to be scaled out across multiple machines, potentially with dedicated hardware for different parts of the pipeline (e.g., simulation, NN training).

### 11.3 Game Engine and Platform Expansion

Beyond core AI and performance, the roadmap includes expanding the game's reach and integration with other platforms and engines. One goal is to enable WebAssembly (WASM) compilation for the game and AI logic, allowing it to run in web browsers. This would facilitate easier deployment, sharing of agents, and web-based tournaments. Integration with more full-featured game engines like Bevy is also a possibility. While the current architecture focuses on the AI and server logic, integrating with an engine like Bevy would allow for the development of richer graphical clients and more complex game modes, while still leveraging the robust Rust backend for simulation and AI. These expansions aim to make the Bomberman AI framework more versatile and accessible to a wider community of developers and researchers.
