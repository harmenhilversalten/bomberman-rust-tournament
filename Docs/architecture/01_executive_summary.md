## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Overview of AI Agent Design

This document outlines a comprehensive architecture for an AI agent designed for a Bomberman-inspired game, leveraging the Rust programming language for its performance, safety, and concurrency features. The primary goal of this architecture is to provide a robust and scalable foundation for developing intelligent agents capable of competing effectively in a dynamic game environment. The design emphasizes a modular structure, allowing for independent development and testing of various AI components such as pathfinding, goal management, and bomb planning. A key aspect of the architecture is its ability to support both traditional programmatic AI, based on predefined rules and heuristics, and more advanced machine learning approaches, particularly reinforcement learning (RL). The system is engineered to handle large-scale game environments, targeting performance at 60 Hz on expansive 256x256 grids with potentially hundreds of bots, ensuring that decision-making processes are both rapid and efficient. This high-level overview sets the stage for a detailed exploration of the individual components and their interactions, which are critical for achieving the desired performance and flexibility.

### 1.2 Key Enhancements and Focus Areas

This revised version of the AI agent architecture incorporates several key enhancements aimed at improving modularity, robustness, and readiness for reinforcement learning. A significant focus has been placed on ensuring a clean separation of concerns, with distinct crates for core functionalities like state management, engine logic, pathfinding, goal selection, and bomb strategy. This modularity not only simplifies development and maintenance but also facilitates the integration of new features, such as novel power-ups or modified game rules, with minimal impact on existing code. The architecture now explicitly includes fallback mechanisms to enhance the robustness of the agents, allowing them to revert to safer or more exploratory behaviors when primary plans fail or when faced with uncertain situations. Furthermore, the design has been bolstered to better support RL pipelines, with dedicated hooks and interfaces for integrating neural networks. This includes provisions for observation serialization, policy execution, and reward buffering, paving the way for training agents that can learn and adapt through experience. These enhancements collectively contribute to a more polished and future-proof foundation for developing advanced Bomberman AI.

### 1.3 Reinforcement Learning (RL) Integration Strategy

The architecture is designed to seamlessly integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) alongside traditional programmatic AI, offering a flexible pathway for developing more adaptive and intelligent agents. While programmatic logic, driven by predefined rules and heuristics, serves as the default mode for basic or rule-based bots, the system provides explicit hooks for neural network (NN) based decision-making. This is primarily facilitated through a new rl crate, which will house the interfaces and implementations for policies, value estimators, and environment wrappers. The Bot Kernel, the core decision-making unit for each agent, is designed to dynamically switch between programmatic and RL modes. This switching can be controlled, for instance, via configuration flags, allowing for A/B testing of different AI approaches or for using programmatic agents as baselines or opponents during RL training. During the training phase, the system will expose Gym-compatible environments, enabling a standardized observation-action-reward loop that can be utilized by common RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DQN) and libraries. For inference, trained NNs can override critical components of the agent's decision-making process, such as goal selection or action planning, allowing learned behaviors to take precedence.
