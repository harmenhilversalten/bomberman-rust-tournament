Bomberman Using Rust Project - BURP

= Goals

This project is intended as a small project to discover the main features and language idiom of Rust. The main idea is 
that participants write bots, improve bots and let the system run tournaments to determine the best bot.

= What is Rust

You know C++? C#? Great, Rust provides a good way to get you finally into productive mode, especially if you are working with threads or low level code.

See [Docs/examples/example_crate](Docs/examples/example_crate) for a minimal example crate demonstrating SOLID design.
